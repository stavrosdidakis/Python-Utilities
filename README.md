## Scripts Overview

### üìù BatchWordToPDF
Recursively converts `.doc` and `.docx` files in a folder into `.pdf` format using `unoconv`. Maintains the original folder structure.

3.	Open Network tab, and paste `timedtext` inside `Filter`. Copy the `Request URL` content and paste it into the URL of a new browser window.
4.	Pass the downloaded file into the `getSubs.py` code (run using python, make sure that the directory of the file and the script are the same)
5.	You will receive a new `extracted_text.txt` file (in the same directory)
